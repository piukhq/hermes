Provide a list of payment card tokens to be redacted from Spreedly. This list can be
generated by the `collect-payment-card-tokens` command.

A new token file will be generated with any tokens that failed to be redacted that can be used to retry.
A failure file with more details on the failures will also be generated separately.
